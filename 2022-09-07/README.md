## Concat
- Combining (Linking) 2 things together.
- Concatenation Operator -> +

## Heterogenous Concatenation
### number & string
- In JS, the + operator is having multiple purposes, for numbers, it will perform mathematical addition. For strings, it will perform concatenation.
- number + number = number
- string + string = string
- When use + operator with number and string, it will give priority to string and make the number also string.
- string + number = string
- number + string = string

### Array & String
- This will just concatenate directly.
- It will put commas in between for the array and just concatenate the string afterwards. 

**BEDMAS -> Brackets, Exponents, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction.**

## string templating / Template Literals / String Literals:
- Introduced in ES6 (2015)
- Example:
  - Getting OTP message for Transaction.
  - Your OTP for Tranaction for 100 Rupees with Card Number ending with XX1234 is 987123.
  - Template:
    - Your OTP for Transaction for <amount> Rupees with Card Number ending with XX<CardNumber> is <OTPValue>.
- This is a string that we define and fill with the actual data that we have and then use it.
- Syntax:
- To create a string, we use backtick ``.
- Inside the template, if we want to use a variable, we use ${}.
- There can be any JS execution, like some calculation or even a function call.
- But it was to be inside of ${}.
- We should use it everywhere.


### Further Reading:
- Type conversion and Datatype priorities.


## Assignment:
- To be done in Vanilla JS.
- Create a form, take the first name and last name.
- Take the email.
- When the button is clicked for form submit.
- Show the message (as alert or inside the DOM).
- `Hello <first_name> <last_name>, we will reach out to you shortly at <email>.`.
- Using string templating.





## Primitive vs Non Primitive Datatypes

### async / await (callback hell)
### Event Loop

# fetch

# JSON

# useEffect
- API Calls

- Event Object







## Emojee - Emoji search application - Start,





### IMPORTANT
- Object.freeze() / Object.isFrozen()
- Object.seal() / Object.isSealed()

## Unit of measurement

## BOM
- BOM is parent of DOM.

- CDN Approach

## Linting / Linter

- Changing of
src / href
id
classList




- entries()
- hasOwnProperty()





Object.keys.forEach


## Multi dimensional arrays 

- <String>.split
### Shallow Copy | Deep Copy

### NaN

### Pure function



### OOP
### oop with this keyword.
### getters and setters
### function declaration vs arrow functions (using this).
## this -> call/apply/bind (during OOP)
## new keyword;

## setInterval/clearInterval + setTimeout/clearTimeout

### RegEX
## Various functions of console.
