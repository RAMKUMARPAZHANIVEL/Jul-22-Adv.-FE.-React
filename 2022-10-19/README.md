### Base64
- This is an encoding which is of a string data type.
- Any file from any format can be converted into base 64.
- The benefit is that we can convert it back into the oginal file.
- Imagine, we have a video. We convert it into base64 string (it will be a really long string) and then we take prinout of that. Then, we send courier to our friend, who then scan it and convert it back into the video format.
