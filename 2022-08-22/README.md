## Helpful Extensions
- VS Code
  - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets
  - This allows us to write easy boilerplate code.
  - This makes writing React App more easy.

- Browser (Chromium | Firefox)
  - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/
  - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en
  - This makes the debugging easy.
  - This the developer tools for React Application.


# ReactJS

## Getting Started using NPM.
- NPM Approach
- Create a new Directory.
- Inside that directory, open the terminal / CMD.
- run the command, `npx create-react-app first`.
- It is `npx creact-react-app <app_name>`.
- This will take some time. (More time if we are running this for the first time).
- After we see Happy Hacking!
- Change the directory into the project directory.
- To start the server, (To start the output display), run `npm start`.
- Once done, we will see a rotating/spinning React icon.

## Alternate approach (Browser only)
- https://codesandbox.io/
- This is a free service, but for limited accounts.
- Can register with Github.
- Might have a better development speed.
- This is recommended for those who don't have good spec machine.


## NodeJS
- It is a software used to Execute JS outside of a browser.
- It is a open-source, cross-platform, runtime environment for javascript.
- Alternatives:
  - DenoJS
  - BunJS

## NPM
- In JS, there is a concept of Modules.
- These modules can be converted to packages.
- Packages are third party developed JS code that we can just install, import and use.
- This saves us time as we don't need to re-invent the wheel.
- Now, we are dependent on that package.
- NPMJS is a directory of all the packages. It contains the list, then the description, github connections, download info, etc etc.
- Node Package Manager
- If I am creating/working on any application, I might need some packages to help me (to prevent from reinventing the wheel). Now, these packages which I need to add, I also need a way to add/manage them. NPM is that way.
- NPM helps me add and manage any additional package that I need for my application.

## Task:
- Create a react application and in the HTML, create a basic about me page. No need of any fancy CSS for now. Just the html basic is okay.












## NPX

## create-react-app



- CDN Approach

- Event Object



- Changing of
src / href
id
classList




## BOM
- BOM is parent of DOM.

### Spread Operator | Rest - Recap | 


### Destructuring

## Modules (import, export)
### Concatenation














- entries()
- hasOwnProperty()



- Interview Examples:
-- Try to have keys as not a string.


### IMPORTANT
- Object.freeze() / Object.isFrozen()
- Object.seal() / Object.isSealed()

Object.keys.forEach


## Multi dimensional arrays 

- <String>.split
### Shallow Copy | Deep Copy

### NaN

### Pure function

### async / await (callback hell)

### OOP
### getters and setters
### function declaration vs arrow functions (using this).
## this -> call/apply/bind (during OOP)
## new keyword;

## setInterval/clearInterval + setTimeout/clearTimeout

### RegEX
## Various functions of console.

## Primitive vs Non Primitive

## casing
## Object.freeze()
## string templating
## Concatenation
