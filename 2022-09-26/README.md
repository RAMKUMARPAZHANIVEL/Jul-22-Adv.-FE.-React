## CSS Calc
- This is a built in method of CSS.
- This is used to calcualate the dimensions.
- We can perform basic mathematical operations inside it.
- The units of measurement can be heterogenous.
- The browser will take care of conversion and everything.
- Since CSS is not a programming language, we need to take care of some things like the space.
- There NEEDS to be space between the different dimensions.

## Outline vs Border
- Borders are at the edge of the element.
- Outline can go outside the limits of the element.
- To do that, we use outline-offset property.

## Moment JS
- Used for better time parsing.
- Very cool feature, it can give reference time. (1 day ago, 3 weeks ago, 2 years ago).
- It is a super popular package, can be used in Vanilla JS, React Application, NodeJS, anything JS.
- We can use it to compare time.
- We can use it to format the date/time as well.
- To install: `npm install moment`
